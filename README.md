ImageCompadre helps you easily compare images from the comfort of your own computer.\
From the toolbar, you can easily select before/after images, see the current amount of zoom, change the zoom speed, and set the before/after titles and the comparison description.\
Use mousewheel to zoom, and mouseclick anywhere on the comparison image to drag the comparison slider.
